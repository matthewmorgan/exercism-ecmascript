# Secret Handshake

Write a program that will take a decimal number, and convert it to the appropriate sequence of events for a secret handshake.

> There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand
> binary, and those who don't.

You and your fellow cohort of those in the "know" when it comes to
binary decide to come up with a secret "handshake".

```
1 = wink
10 = double blink
100 = close your eyes
1000 = jump


10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.
```

```
handshake = SecretHandshake.new 9
handshake.commands # => ["wink","jump"]

handshake = SecretHandshake.new "11001"
handshake.commands # => ["jump","wink"]
```

The program should consider strings specifying an invalid binary as the
value 0.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for ECMAScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-ecmascript.html

## Requirements

They are already described in the link above, but just as a
quick reference:

Install globally a tool to run [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) if
it is not installed yet:

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp-cli
```

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ gulp test
```

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
